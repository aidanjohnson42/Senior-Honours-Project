# Senior-Honours-Project
A place to store any important general attachments for my Senior Honours Project on Modelling Observations of Warped Protoplanetary Discs!
This project is running for 10 weeks in January - March during semester 2 of my Senior Honours year as an Astrophysics undergraduate. It is being supervised by Dr Alison K. Young and Professor Ken Rice and is aimed to be completed March 31st. 
I declare all files uploaded to this repository to be my own work.

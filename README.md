# Senior-Honours-Project
A place to store general attachments for my Senior Honours Project on Modelling Observations of Warped Protoplanetary Discs, which are unable to fit into the paper!
This project ran for 10 weeks in January - March 2023 during semester 2 of my Senior Honours year as an Astrophysics undergraduate. It was supervised by Dr Alison K. Young and Professor Ken Rice and was completed March 31st. 
I declare all files uploaded to this repository to be my own work.
